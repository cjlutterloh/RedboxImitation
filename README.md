# RedboxImitation
Java program that tracks DVD rentals, similar to a Redbox kiosk.

The list of movies in the kiosk is sorted using a custom binary search tree, and users are able to rent and return movies, in addition to Redbox employees. Validation is a major focus of the program, as some orders may have missing data due to technical glitches.
